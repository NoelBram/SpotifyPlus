# SpotifyMixTape

### Overview

SpotifyMixTape is an app that creates playlists gathered from all new songs in your Release Radar, Daily Weekly, and Daily Mix playlists on your Spotify account.

Your SpotifyMixTape custom playlist will only include songs you haven't previously liked and NOT ones you chose to hide.

Using the SpotifyMixTape app daily will save time and energy, allowing you to listen to new content without skipping and changing to another song or playlist to find that hidden gem.
